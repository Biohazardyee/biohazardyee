# Hey Fellow Tech Enthusiast! 👋

## About Me 🚀

I'm **Thibaud “Biohazard” Marlier**, an aspiring **Full-Stack Developer** currently studying at **SUPINFO — Tours, France**.  
Previously I studied at [ALGOSUP](https://algosup.com/en.html) (Vierzon) where I learned through project-based, English-taught programs.

I also serve as a **Reservist in the French Gendarmerie**, which strengthens my discipline, leadership, and teamwork — qualities I bring to every project.

My mission is to contribute to advancements that promote **ecological sustainability**, **technological innovation**, and **societal well-being** — building secure and efficient systems for a better future.
