## Projects ðŸŒŸ

### School Projects

- **Project [Virtual Processor](https://github.com/algosup/2023-2024-project-3-virtual-processor-team-3)**: During this project, we created a **virtual processor** from scratch using the **C programming language**. We aimed to develop an **educational** CPU that could be utilized by everyone, from beginners to professional developers. Additionally, we created a **compiler** capable of compiling our assembly language. This project provided an excellent opportunity to deepen our understanding of CPU functionality and compiler construction. (Project Manager)

- **Project [AdoptACandidate](https://github.com/algosup/2023-2024-project-5-flutter-team-3)**: During this project, we developed a Tinder-like mobile application designed to streamline the recruitment process for both job-seekers and HR professionals. The application focused on fostering anonymity to reduce biases in hiring, enabling fairer and more inclusive matches between candidates and companies. Built using Flutter and the Dart programming language, this project offered an excellent opportunity to explore modern mobile application development while addressing key challenges in the recruitment industry.
